                <h5 class="w3-padding-32 oldpage" align="justify">Bad Reichenhall is a significant district town in the
                    administrative area
                    of Upper Bavaria and the district town of Berchtesgadener Land. The city has a four thousand year
                    history that
                    is intimately related to the mining of salt from brine. In Germany, Bad Reichenhaller Alpensalz has
                    a market share of more than
                    50%. Since the middle of the nineteenth century, the town has been recognized as a spa and holiday
                    destination; the spa has been
                    in its name since 1890, and the town was accorded the title of Royal Bavarian State Spa in 1899. The
                    spa town is located in Saalachtal,
                    which is surrounded by the slopes of the Berchtesgaden and Chiemgau Alps.
                    <p>During the Bell Beaker civilization, there was already a
                        permanent settlement
                        and significant trading networks,
                        according to finds in the Reichenhall area (2600 to 2300 BC). This was only accurately verified
                        by
                        the discovery of several burial sites from the
                        Urnfield period (1600-750 BC) in the vicinity of today's Karlstein district. There was also a
                        Celtic
                        worship site in the Langacker valley and a mint at
                        the "Haiderburgstein" during the La Tène period (450-15 BC).</p>

                    The trademark ja! was launched in 1982 to compete with Aldi with a low-cost brand. Kaiser +
                    Kellermann joined the trade group in 1983,
                    and Rewe eventually acquired a 75% share in the firm. The purchase of 50% of Atlas Travel Agency
                    means joining the tourist business.
                    With the acquisition of ITS Reisen in the mid-1990s, the company made another investment in this
                    market. The Bon appétit Group (see Usego) was acquired in 2003.
                    Rewe expanded throughout the new federal states following German reunification. For example, the
                    first supermarkets were erected in Weimar and Berlin. Rewe took over
                    the Austrian group around Billa and Merkur in 1996 after experimenting with setting up Penny-branded
                    stores in England, Italy, Spain, and France. 
                    <p> According to a historian on the BBC's Inside the
                        Factory, there
                        was a cookbook
                        recipe in England in 1817 outlining how to create chips.
                        According to a popular culinary legend, potato chips were developed on August 24, 1853 by George
                        Crum, a cook at the Hotel Moon Lake Lodge in Saratoga Springs, New York,
                        when a guest - supposed to be industrial mogul Cornelius Vanderbilt - complained about overly
                        thick
                        fried potatoes. To Crum's amazement, when they were ultimately so thin that they couldn't be
                        eaten
                        with a fork,
                        the guests enjoyed them, and his innovation was subsequently introduced to the menu as Saratoga
                        chips. They quickly became well-known across New England. The local museum suggests that Crum's
                        sister accidently slipped a too-thin slice of potato into hot fat, and Crum was so delighted
                        with the result that he offered the potato chips at the restaurant.

                <h1>Stone</h1>
                <h5 class="w3-padding-32 oldpage" align="justify">A stone is a fragment of rock. It is a hard,
                    compressed
                    mineral mass. The term
                    is frequently used to refer to a little chunk of rock.
                    Natural rock, particularly as a construction material, is frequently referred to as "stone."
                    Granite, marble, and sandstone are examples of natural stones used in construction.
                    Stone does not include manufactured, artificial items such as concrete or clay bricks. The stone
                    takes time to heat up and stays hot for a long time. It has poor electrical conductivity.
                    Stone was among the earliest materials used to create tools and structures. It's a really strong
                    substance. It is less susceptible to weather than wood or brick.
                    Stone weathers significantly more slowly depending on the type of rock.

                    but because to trademark concerns with the Axe name, was compelled to adopt the name Lynx in the
                    United Kingdom,
                    Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Furthermore, other nations (such as South Africa) launched the

                    <p>Mum, the first modern commercial deodorant,
                        was invented and patented in 1888 by Edna Murphey, a Philadelphia,
                        Pennsylvania-based inventor. Bristol-Myers purchased the little firm in 1931,
                        and Helen Barnett Diserens created an underarm applicator based on the newly invented
                        ball-point pen in the late 1940s. The product was first marketed under the name Ban Roll-On in
                        1952.
                        The product was momentarily removed off the market in the United States, but it is now
                        accessible at
                        merchants
                        in the United States under the name Ban. Mum Solid and Mum Pump Spray are the brand names used
                        in
                        the United Kingdom.
                        Chattem purchased the Ban deodorant brand in 1998 and then sold it to Kao Corporation in 2000.

                <h5 class="w3-padding-32 oldpage" align="justify">
                    The Spanish brought potatoes from the Americas to Europe in the second part of the 16th century.
                    They are now a staple food in many regions of the world, as well as an essential component of much
                    of the world's food supply.
                    Potatoes were the world's fourth-largest food crop in 2014, after only maize (corn), wheat, and
                    rice.
                    There are currently over 5,000 different varieties of potatoes as a result of millennia of selective
                    breeding.
                    Over 99% of the potatoes grown now are descended from cultivars that originated in the plains of
                    south-central Chile.
                    The potato's value as a food source and culinary element varies by area and is always changing. It
                    is still an important crop in Europe,
                    particularly in Northern and Eastern Europe.
                    <p> Pre-Columbian farmers initially cultivated the potato
                        near Lake
                        Titicaca in modern-day southern Peru and northwestern Bolivia.
                        Since then, it has expanded around the world and has become a staple crop in many nations.
                        The oldest archaeologically proven potato tuber remnants date from 2500 BC and were discovered
                        at
                        the coastal settlement of Ancon (central Peru).
                        Solanum tuberosum tuberosum, the most extensively grown variety, is endemic to the Chiloé
                        Archipelago and has been farmed by the local indigenous people since before the Spanish
                        invasion.

                    It is unknown who was the first to develop soap.
                    The oldest indication of soap-like compounds being produced goes back to roughly 2800 BC in ancient
                    Babylon. Around 2500 BC,
                    a method for making soap was written on a Sumerian clay tablet;
                    the soap was made by heating a mixture of oil and wood ash, the first documented chemical reaction,
                    and was used to wash woolen clothes.
                    According to the Ebers papyrus (Egypt, 1550 BC), the ancient Egyptians used soap as a remedy and
                    made their soaps by combining animal fats or
                    vegetable oils with a soda ash material called Trona. According to Egyptian texts, a similar
                    chemical was employed in the processing of wool for weaving.
                    <p>In the late sixth century (when Naples was under the
                        rule of the
                        Eastern Roman Empire),
                        soapmakers formed a guild, and by the eighth century, soap-making was well known in Italy and
                        Spain.
                        The Carolingian capitulary De Villis, which dates approximately 800 and represents Charlemagne's
                        royal testament,
                        includes soap as one of the items the stewards of royal estates are to tally. By 800, Medieval
                        Spain's territories were a dominant soapmaker,
                        while soapmaking began in the Kingdom of England about 1200. Soapmaking is cited as both
                        "women's
                        labour" and "excellent workmen's output,"
                        among other requirements such as carpenters', blacksmiths', and bakers' produce.</p>

                    (Greater
                    Shepparton, Victoria),
                    and were supplied by the Shepparton-based dairy firm Ducats. At the 1970s and early 1980s, they were
                    also used in Gympie,
                    Queensland, and about the same period in Caboolture, Queensland. These were a pint size.
                    <p>In the United Kingdom, Sainsbury's conducted a test
                        operation
                        with Dairy Crest in 2008 to distribute milk in bags.
                        It was initially intended for 35 retailers at the same price as a conventional 2-imperial-pint
                        (1.1
                        l) plastic milk bottle.
                        In 2010, the product was expanded nationwide, and the bags were sold at a lower price than
                        standard
                        containers.
                        The bags are typically used in conjunction with a particular plastic jug in the United Kingdom.
                        The bag fits snuggly inside the jug; one corner of the bag is locked under a bar at the front of
                        the
                        jug, and when the top is closed, the bag is perforated and a spout glides into the hole,
                        enabling
                        the milk to be readily dispensed while keeping freshness.</p>

                <h5 class="w3-padding-32 oldpage" align="justify">Since ancient times, a variety of plants and their
                    extracts
                    have been utilized
                    as
                    shampoo on the Indian subcontinent. Shampoo originated in the Indus Valley Civilization. Sapindus
                    was boiled
                    with dried Indian gooseberry (amla) and a variety of other herbs, and the filtered extract was used
                    to make a highly
                    efficient early shampoo. Sapindus, often known as soapberries or soapnuts, is a tropical tree found
                    across India.
                    Its fruit pulp contains saponins,
                    which function as a natural surfactant. Soapberry extract produces a lather known as phenaka in
                    Indian scriptures.
                    It makes the hair smooth, lustrous(reflecting light evenly),
                    and easy to handle. Shikakai (Acacia concinna), hibiscus blossoms, and ritha were also used to
                    cleanse the hair.
                    <p>Sake Dean Mahomed, a Bengali wanderer, surgeon, and
                        entrepreneur, is credited
                        for bringing shampooing to the United Kingdom.
                        Mahomed created the first commercial "shampooing" vapor masseur bath in England, in Brighton, in
                        1814, with his Irish wife Jane Daly.
                        In a local newspaper, he defined the therapy as "the Indian Medicated Vapor Bath (kind of
                        Turkish
                        bath), a remedy to many ailments and offering full relief when everything else fails;

                        of glass,
                        mica, or cellulose acetate. Glass and mica were extremely fragile and required to be replaced on
                        a
                        regular basis.
                        The subsequent Triplex lens design (a cellulose acetate lens sandwiched between two glass
                        lenses)
                        grew increasingly popular,
                        and it was the standard until the 1930s, alongside plain cellulose acetate. Panoramic lenses did
                        not
                        become popular until the 1930s,
                        however there are cases of them being used even during WWII . Later, stronger polycarbonate was
                        used.

                            was
                            employed as a gas
                            mask
                            in ancient Greece."
                            Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier created the respirator in 1785.
                            Miners utilized primitive respirator prototypes, which Alexander von Humboldt presented in
                            1799
                            while working as
                            a mining engineer in Prussia. Lewis P. Haslett devised the predecessor of the current gas
                            mask
                            in
                            1847,
                            a device that had features that permitted breathing through a nose and mouthpiece, intake of
                            air
                            through a bulb-shaped filter,
                            and exhalation of air back into the atmosphere. According to First Facts, Lewis Phectic
                            patented
